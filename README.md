# Hi, I'm Jason


I've been enjoying robotics software development ever since I built my first project "Cali", an autonomous mobile manipulator designed to perform a Fetch-and-Carry mission. Building Cali from the ground up not only taught me the intricacies of robotics but also ignited my fascination with creating intelligent systems that interact seamlessly with their environment.

As a ROS expert, I'm now eager to bring my skills to a dynamic team focused on cutting-edge robotics software development. I'm actively seeking a role as a **Robotics Software Engineer** or **ROS Developer**, where I can contribute my expertise and continue to grow in this exciting field. If you're hiring, let's chat!
